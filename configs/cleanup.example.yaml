# This file controls what gets cleaned and how

# Enable/disable cleanup categories

  cache: true            # Browser caches, app caches, system caches
  temp: true             # Temporary files
  logs: true             # Log files
  duplicates: false      # Duplicate files (CAUTION: Can be aggressive)
  downloads: false       # Old files in Downloads folder (CAUTION: Review before enabling)
  package_managers: true # Package manager caches (brew, apt, npm, etc.)

# Age thresholds (in days) - Only clean files older than these thresholds
age_thresholds:
  logs: 30        # Clean log files older than 30 days
  downloads: 90   # Clean downloads older than 90 days
  temp: 7         # Clean temp files older than 7 days

# Size limits for files to consider
size_limits:
  min_file_size: "1KB"   # Ignore files smaller than this
  max_file_size: "10GB"  # Skip files larger than this (safety measure)

# Paths listed here will never be cleaned

  - "/Applications"
  - "/usr"
  - "/etc"
  - "/var"

# Dry-run mode - When true, shows what would be deleted without actually deleting
